# 🍷 Red Wine Quality Analysis (EDA Project)

## 📘 Overview

This project explores the **Red Wine Quality dataset** to understand how various physicochemical properties influence wine quality.
Using **Python** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** techniques, key patterns and correlations were identified to determine which factors most strongly impact wine ratings.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze and visualize the relationships between wine features and quality.
* Identify key factors contributing to higher quality scores.
* Perform data cleaning, statistical analysis, and feature correlation studies.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

* **Programming:** Python
* **Libraries:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Steps

1. Data Cleaning and preprocessing
2. Descriptive statistics and distribution analysis
3. Correlation analysis and visualization (heatmaps, pairplots)
4. Feature importance insights for wine quality prediction

---

## 🔍 Insights

* **Alcohol**, **volatile acidity**, and **sulphates** are the most influential factors for wine quality.
* Higher alcohol content and balanced acidity generally correspond to higher quality ratings.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** — Red Wine Quality dataset.

## 🧠 Future Scope

* Build predictive ML models (Regression or Classification) to estimate wine quality.
* Extend analysis to compare **Red vs White wine datasets**.
